# Experiment Tracking

There are several libraries that can be used for experiment tracking in machine learning models. Here are some of the most popular ones:

TensorBoard: This is a visualization tool included with TensorFlow that can be used to track and visualize metrics such as loss and accuracy over time. It also provides a way to visualize the computational graph of a model and monitor training progress.

MLflow: This is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides a way to track experiments, package code into reproducible runs, and deploy models to production.

Sacred: This is a lightweight library for experiment tracking and configuration management. It provides a way to define experiments as Python functions with configurable parameters, and record metrics and results.

Wandb: This is a cloud-based platform for experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization, and visualization. It provides a way to track experiments across multiple machines and collaborate with team members.

Neptune: This is a cloud-based platform for experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration. It provides a way to record and compare experiments, and collaborate with team members in real-time.

Each of these libraries has its own strengths and use cases, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs and workflow.


# Tensorboard vs mlflow

TensorBoard and MLflow are two popular platforms for experiment tracking in machine learning, but they have different strengths and use cases.

TensorBoard is a visualization tool included with TensorFlow that can be used to track and visualize metrics such as loss and accuracy over time. It provides a way to visualize the computational graph of a model and monitor training progress. TensorBoard is best suited for projects that use TensorFlow, as it is tightly integrated with the library and provides a way to visualize the internal workings of TensorFlow models.

On the other hand, MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides a way to track experiments, package code into reproducible runs, and deploy models to production. MLflow supports multiple machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, and provides a unified interface for experiment tracking across different libraries. MLflow also provides features for model versioning and collaboration, making it well-suited for teams working on large-scale machine learning projects.

In summary, TensorBoard is best suited for projects that use TensorFlow and require detailed visualization of model performance and internal workings. MLflow is best suited for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, packaging code, and deploying models to production.
