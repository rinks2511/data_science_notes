# Command Line Interface

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way of interacting with a computer system or software application using text commands typed into a terminal or command prompt, instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and menus.

CLI is used for a variety of reasons, including:

Efficiency: CLI commands can be much faster to execute than performing the same actions through a GUI. CLI also allows for automation and scripting of repetitive tasks.

Flexibility: CLI can be used on a wide variety of systems and platforms, regardless of the graphical interface or operating system.

Accessibility: CLI can be used on systems that do not have a graphical interface or when remote access is required.

Precision: CLI allows for more precise and specific actions to be taken than a GUI, which can be prone to errors or unintended actions.

Expertise: Many advanced or specialized tasks can only be performed using CLI commands, which require a higher level of technical knowledge and expertise.

Overall, CLI provides a powerful and flexible way of interacting with computer systems and software applications, allowing for efficient and precise control and management of resources.

# Comman CLI
There are many command line tools used in software development and DevOps. Here are some of the most common ones:

Bash: Bash is a Unix shell and command language that is widely used on Linux and macOS systems. It provides a command line interface to interact with the operating system, run scripts, and automate tasks.

Git: Git is a distributed version control system that is used to manage source code and collaborate on software development projects. It allows developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others.

Docker: Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. It allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a portable container that can be run on any system that supports Docker.

Terraform: Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that is used to provision and manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers. It allows developers to define their infrastructure as code and apply changes in a consistent and automated way.

Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a platform for running and managing containerized applications across multiple hosts.

AWS CLI: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that allows developers to interact with AWS services using commands in the terminal. It provides a command line interface to manage AWS resources, automate tasks, and develop scripts.

Vim: Vim is a text editor that is widely used by developers to edit files in the command line. It provides a powerful set of commands and shortcuts for editing and navigating text.

These are just a few of the many command line tools that are commonly used in software development and DevOps.
