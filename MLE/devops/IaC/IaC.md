# Infrastructure as code (IaC)
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources (such as servers, networks, and storage) using code instead of manual configuration. With IaC, you can define your infrastructure resources as code, store them in a version control system, and automate their deployment and management.

There are several popular libraries and tools used for infrastructure as code in the DevOps community, including:

Terraform: Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure. It supports multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, as well as on-premises infrastructure.

AWS CloudFormation: AWS CloudFormation is a managed service that provides templates for defining AWS resources as code. It automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources in the AWS cloud.

Google Cloud Deployment Manager: Google Cloud Deployment Manager is a service that lets you define your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources as code. It automates the deployment and management of resources in the GCP cloud.

Ansible: Ansible is an open-source automation tool that supports configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It allows you to write code in a YAML format to describe the desired state of your infrastructure.

Chef: Chef is an open-source automation tool for configuration management and infrastructure provisioning. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for describing the desired state of your infrastructure.

Puppet: Puppet is an open-source automation tool for configuration management and infrastructure provisioning. It uses a declarative language to describe the desired state of your infrastructure.

SaltStack: SaltStack is an open-source automation tool for configuration management and infrastructure provisioning. It uses a YAML format to describe the desired state of your infrastructure.

These tools and libraries help DevOps professionals to write, manage, and automate infrastructure resources using code. They also provide a high degree of flexibility, scalability, and consistency in managing infrastructure, which is essential for modern DevOps practices.
