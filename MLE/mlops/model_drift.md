# Model Drift
To measure drift at the time of offline evaluation and online inference for robustness enhancement, here are some techniques that can be used:

## Offline Evaluation:
### Dataset Comparison:
- This technique involves comparing the statistics of the new dataset with the original training dataset. 
- Any significant differences in the distributions of the two datasets can indicate drift.

### Model Comparison: 
- This technique involves comparing the performance of the new model with the original model on the same dataset.
- If there is a significant drop in performance, it may indicate drift.

### Drift Detection Algorithms: 
- There are several drift detection algorithms available that can be used to detect drift in the data or model. 
- Some popular algorithms include 
  - the Kullback-Leibler divergence 
  - and the Page-Hinkley test.

## Online Inference:
### Statistical Process Control: 
- Statistical process control (SPC) involves monitoring the performance of the model in real-time 
- and identifying any deviations from the expected behavior. 
- If the performance of the model deviates significantly from the expected behavior, it may indicate drift.

### Data Sampling: 
- This technique involves randomly sampling a small subset of the data at regular intervals 
- and comparing the distribution of the data with the original training dataset. 
- Any significant differences can indicate drift.

### Feedback Loops:
- Feedback loops can be used to monitor the performance of the model in real-time 
- and provide feedback to the system. 
- This can help to identify any issues or changes in the data that may impact the model's performance.

By using these techniques to measure drift at the time of offline evaluation and online inference, data scientists can ensure that their models are robust and reliable over time. 
They can also take appropriate actions to retrain the model or update the system to address any drift that is detected.


# Correcting for drift
- If drift is detected in the data or model, there are several actions that data scientists can take to address the issue. 
- The appropriate action will depend on the specific cause of the drift and the nature of the system being used. 

Here are some general actions that can be taken:

### Retrain the Model: 
- If the drift is caused by changes in the data distribution, retraining the model on the new data can help to improve its performance.

### Update the Model: 
- If the drift is caused by changes in the underlying system or environment, updating the model to better reflect these changes can help to improve its performance.

### Adjust the Parameters: 
- If the drift is caused by changes in the input data, adjusting the model parameters may help to improve its performance.

### Add New Features: 
- If the drift is caused by changes in the data, adding new features or variables to the model may help to capture these changes and improve its performance.

### Evaluate the System: 
- If the drift is caused by issues with the underlying system or environment, evaluating the system and making necessary updates or changes can help to address the issue.

### Monitor the System: 
- Monitoring the system in real-time can help to detect drift early and take appropriate actions to address it.
