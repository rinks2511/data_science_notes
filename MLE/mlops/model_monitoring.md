# Model Monitoring tools
There are many tools available for monitoring the performance of machine learning models continuously. Here are some popular tools:

### TensorBoard: 
- TensorBoard is a tool from Google that allows you to visualize your model's performance metrics, including loss and accuracy, in real-time. 
- It is compatible with TensorFlow and Keras.

### MLflow: 
- MLflow is an open-source platform that allows you to track experiments, package code, and manage models.
- It supports multiple machine learning frameworks and provides a UI for visualizing performance metrics.

### Hugging Face: 
- Hugging Face is a platform for building and sharing natural language processing (NLP) models. 
- It provides a dashboard for monitoring model performance and allows you to compare the performance of different models.

### Neptune.ai: 
- Neptune.ai is a cloud-based platform that allows you to track, visualize, and compare experiments across machine learning frameworks. 
- It supports Python and R and provides integrations with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### Kibana: 
- Kibana is an open-source platform for visualizing and analyzing data. 
- It can be used for monitoring model performance by creating custom dashboards to display key metrics.

### ModelDB: 
- ModelDB is an open-source platform for managing machine learning models. 
- It allows you to track experiments, compare model performance, and store metadata about your models.

These are just a few examples of the many tools available for monitoring machine learning models continuously. The choice of tool will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the project.
