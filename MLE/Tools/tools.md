# Tools
There are various tools used in different phases of an ML project. Here are some commonly used tools in each phase of the ML project:

## Data collection and preprocessing:
- Web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing tools like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.
- Data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Feature engineering:
 - Feature extraction tools like scikit-learn and Featuretools.
- Feature transformation tools like scikit-learn and PySpark.

## Model selection and training:
 - Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library in Python for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.
- TensorFlow and Keras: Open-source machine learning libraries that allow developers to create and train neural networks.
 - PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library that provides developers with tools to build and train deep neural networks.

## Model evaluation and tuning:
- Scikit-learn: Provides a range of evaluation metrics and tools to compare models.
- TensorFlow and Keras: Include various callbacks, tensorboard, and other tools to monitor and evaluate models during training.
- Hyperopt: A popular tool used to tune hyperparameters for ML models.

## Deployment:
- Flask and Django: Web frameworks used for deploying ML models as web services.
- Docker: A containerization platform used to package and deploy ML models in a consistent and scalable way.
- Kubernetes: A container orchestration tool used to manage and deploy ML models at scale.
