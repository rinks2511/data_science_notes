# Pylint Cheat Sheet

## Installation
You can install Pylint using pip:

`pip install pylint`

## Usage
To run Pylint on a Python file, use the following command:
`pylint <filename>.py`

By default, Pylint will output a score for the file and a list of any errors, warnings, or convention issues it finds.

## Configuration
You can configure Pylint using a .pylintrc file. This file should be placed in the root of your project directory.

The .pylintrc file should contain a list of options in the following format:

```
[FORMAT]

option1=value1
option2=value2

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

option3=value3
option4=value4
```

You can find a list of available options in the Pylint documentation.

## Score
Pylint assigns a score to each file it analyzes, based on the number of errors, warnings, and convention issues it finds.

The score ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 being a perfect score.

## Errors
Pylint identifies errors in your code, such as syntax errors and undefined variables.

Errors are assigned a severity of "E" and can be fixed by modifying the code.

## Warnings
Pylint identifies warnings in your code, such as unused variables and imports.

Warnings are assigned a severity of "W" and should be reviewed to ensure they are not indicative of a larger issue.

## Convention
Pylint identifies convention issues in your code, such as incorrect indentation and naming conventions.

Convention issues are assigned a severity of "C" and are not necessarily indicative of an error, but should be fixed to ensure consistency and readability in the code.
