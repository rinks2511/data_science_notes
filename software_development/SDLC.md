# SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to plan, design, develop, test, deploy and maintain software applications. The SDLC is a framework that helps ensure software projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet the requirements of stakeholders.

The SDLC typically includes the following stages:

Planning: In this stage, the project goals and requirements are defined, and a project plan is created. The feasibility of the project is also evaluated.

Analysis: In this stage, the requirements are analyzed in detail, and a functional specification document is created. The document includes the detailed requirements and features of the software application.

Design: In this stage, the software architecture is designed, and the technical specifications are created. The design includes the details of the database, user interface, and system architecture.

Development: In this stage, the actual coding of the software application takes place. The development process may follow a specific methodology such as Agile or Waterfall.

Testing: In this stage, the software application is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications. The testing process includes both functional and non-functional testing.

Deployment: In this stage, the software application is deployed to the production environment. This includes the installation of the software, configuration of the system, and migration of the data.

Maintenance: In this stage, the software application is maintained and updated to ensure that it continues to function properly. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and updating the software to meet new requirements.

The SDLC provides a structured approach to software development and helps ensure that the final product meets the requirements and expectations of stakeholders.
