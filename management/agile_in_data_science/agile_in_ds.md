# Agile in data science project
Defining the product backlog is an important step in managing data science projects using Agile methodology. 

Here are the steps to define a product backlog:

## Identify the Stakeholders:
- The first step is to identify the stakeholders who will be using the data science solution. 
- This could be different departments within the organization, clients, or end-users.

## Define User Stories:
- User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality that captures what the user wants to achieve. 
- In data science projects, user stories can be defined based on the data requirements, analytics needs, or business goals.
- Example - "As a marketing analyst, I want to be able to predict which customers are most likely to churn, so that I can proactively target them with retention campaigns and improve overall customer retention rates."

## Prioritize User Stories:
- Once the user stories are defined, the next step is to prioritize them based on their importance and urgency.
- This can be done in collaboration with stakeholders to ensure that the most important features are addressed first.

## Estimate Effort: 
- After prioritizing user stories, it is important to estimate the effort required to complete each story. 
- This can be done using techniques such as story points or hours/days. 
- This will help in planning sprints and setting realistic timelines.

## Create the Product Backlog:
- The final step is to create the product backlog, which is a list of all the user stories, prioritized based on importance and effort estimates. 
- The product backlog should be regularly reviewed and updated as new user stories emerge or priorities change.

## Final comments
- Overall, defining the product backlog in data science projects is a collaborative process that involves the data science team, stakeholders, and project manager. 
- It is important to keep the backlog up-to-date and use it as a guide for planning and executing sprints.

# Roles 

In an Agile data science project with ML engineers, there can be different roles with different responsibilities.

Here are some common roles:

## Product Owner: 
- The product owner is responsible for managing the product backlog, prioritizing user stories, and ensuring that the team is working on the right tasks to meet the project's goals. 
- In an Agile data science project, the product owner is typically a business stakeholder who has a good understanding of the project goals and can provide feedback on the output of the data science team.

## Scrum Master: 
- The scrum master is responsible for facilitating the agile process, ensuring that the team is following the agile principles and practices, and removing any obstacles that might hinder the team's progress. 
- In an Agile data science project, the scrum master should be someone who has experience in data science projects and can provide guidance to the team.

## Data Scientist: 
- The data scientist is responsible for developing and testing the models, ensuring that they meet the requirements and that they are accurate and reliable. 
- In an Agile data science project, the data scientist should be able to work collaboratively with the other team members, provide regular updates on the progress of the model development, and be able to incorporate feedback from the product owner.

## Machine Learning Engineer: 
- The machine learning engineer is responsible for deploying and managing the models, ensuring that they are scalable, reliable, and performant. 
- In an Agile data science project, the ML engineer should work collaboratively with the data scientist to ensure that the models are deployed correctly and are integrated with the production environment.


## Data Engineer: 
- The data engineer is responsible for collecting, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis. 
- In an Agile data science project, the data engineer should work closely with the data scientist to ensure that the data is properly prepared and is available when needed.


## Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: 
- The QA engineer is responsible for ensuring that the product meets the quality standards and is free of any bugs or issues. 
- In an Agile data science project, the QA engineer should work closely with the data scientist to ensure that the models are tested properly and are working as expected.

## DevOps Engineer: 
- The DevOps engineer is responsible for managing the deployment pipeline and ensuring that the models are deployed and updated automatically.
- In an Agile data science project, the DevOps engineer should work closely with the ML engineer to ensure that the models are deployed correctly and are integrated with the production environment.

# Meetings

In an Agile data science project, meetings play a crucial role in ensuring effective communication, collaboration, and progress tracking. 

Here are some of the meetings that are typically held in an Agile data science project:

## Sprint Planning: 
- A meeting where the team plans for the upcoming sprint. 
- The product owner explains the items in the backlog, and the team estimates the effort required to complete them.

## Daily Stand-up: 
- A short meeting held every day to discuss progress, any issues, and plans for the day.
- Each team member answers three questions: 
  - What did I accomplish yesterday? 
  - What am I working on today? 
  - Are there any impediments in my way?

## Sprint Review: 
- A meeting held at the end of the sprint to demonstrate the work completed during the sprint. 
- The team presents the completed items to the stakeholders and gets their feedback.

## Sprint Retrospective: 
- A meeting held at the end of the sprint to review the process and identify areas for improvement. 
- The team discusses what went well, what didn't go well, and how they can improve the process for the next sprint.

## Ad-hoc meetings:
- Meetings that are scheduled as needed to address specific issues or discuss particular topics. 
- For example, if the team faces a challenging technical problem, they might schedule an ad-hoc meeting to brainstorm solutions.

## Technical meetings
- In addition to the above meetings, ML engineers, data scientists, and other team members may hold technical meetings to discuss specific aspects of the project. 
- These meetings might focus on topics such as data preparation, model building, or deployment. 
- It's essential to ensure that all team members have access to the necessary information and are updated on the project's progress regularly.


# Artifacts

In an agile data science project, the following artifacts are typically generated:

## Product backlog: 
- A list of prioritized features and user stories that need to be developed for the project.

## Sprint backlog: 
- A subset of the product backlog that is selected for development during a sprint.

## User stories
- Descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of an end-user.

## Sprint goal: 
- A specific, measurable objective that the team plans to achieve during a sprint.

## Sprint review: 
- A meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders.

## Sprint retrospective: 
- A meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on their process and identifies areas for improvement.

## Data dictionaries: 
- Documentation that defines the structure and contents of datasets used in the project.

## Code repository: 
- A version control system where all code for the project is stored and managed.

## Model documentation: 
- Documentation that describes the algorithms and models used in the project, including inputs, outputs, and assumptions.
