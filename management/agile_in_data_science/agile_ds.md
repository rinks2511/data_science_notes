# Agile in Data Science Project
Efficient method for development


- Agile : a system to manage work using time limited iterations
- Sprint : 1 to 4 weeks cycles delivering 
- Working increment : Output that can be viewed & reviewed
- Story : Single unit of work usually completed within a sprint
- Epic : collection of related user stories

## Why Agile?
Agile projects are -
 - Less likely to fail
 - have greater speed to market
 - higher quality code
 - have more productive & motivated teams

Fixed Sprint cyles + explicit esitmation + review + retro


## Steps

- Requirements definition and analysis of concepts
  - Current State
  - Future Expected State
  - 30 stories need to be implemented (JIRA)
- Planning of sprints
  - Arrange resources & tools required
  - Analytics manager is responsible
    - Align stories in each sprint
    - Hiring done based on sprint & stories
- Collaborative design development
- Create and Implement
- Review and Monitor

## Teams
- Product Manager
- Analytics Manager
  - Plan with product manager and create sprint 

## Timeline
- Entire project : 3 months - 12weeks
- One sprint : 2 weeks
- Total sprints : 12/2 - 6 sprints


## Sprint Planning
- Resource Availability
- Sprint Goal
- What's on card for this sprint?
- Effort Points/ Value points
- Whats in the next sprint?

## Sprint Lookahead (Urgent v/s Important)
Mid sprint every other week
- Review backlog as it stands
- What to do in next sprint?
- Do we have all the tickets we need?

## Sprint Review
 - Review of what's been delivered
 - What's done? What's not done?
 - Everything has a Definition of Done?
 - Celebrate the wins

## Sprint Retrospective
 - What went well?
 - What did not go well?
 - Improvements?

## Planning & Estimation

### Effort estimation
 - Effort points :  Biggest task - 5 point, smallest task - 1 point
 - Value points : stakeholders estimate
 - Order by VP / EP score


## Practical tips
- Stories can rollover into the next sprint
  - Discuss why under estimated, revise EP, learn from it, claim the point next sprint
- Daily Standup
  - Make it about items, not people. Consider others time.
- Use spikes to investigate stories that can't be estimated
- Never skip retro
- Quarterly Epics - align with OKR cycle. Conscious story rollover
- Evolve your retros through agile
- Don't try to replicate other's Agile


## Tools
- Gitlab, JIRA, Github projects, zenhub - project management, code reviews, comms
- Spreadsheets : Planning, Value/ Effort Scoring, Velocity calculation
- Monday.com for Agile ops
- Range for async standups, meeting automation, OKRs
- Metro Retro for retrospectives


## Example

### Sprint 1 (2 weeks - 5 sprints)
 - 5 stories got completed
 - QA testing of all the stories developed in sprint 1

### Sprint 2
 - 5 other stories
 - Fix bugs in sprint 1

.
.
.

### Sprint 6 
 - Development
 - QA testing - all testing & bugs completed
 - Move to UAT(User Acceptance Testing) server
   - Client team to test the UAT
   - Exact replica of product server
 - Production Server
