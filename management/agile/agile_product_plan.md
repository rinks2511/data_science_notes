### Components
 - Date - Release date or timeframe
 - Name - Name of the new release
 - Goal - Reason for creating a new release
 - Features - High level features necessary to meet goals
 - Metrics - Metrics to determine if the goal has been met



## Product Release Plan
 - step by step list of actionable steps
 - Details of how
 - Doable actions

### What is a release?
 - Moment in time when we go to market
 - Project v/s Release 
   - Project : set beginning and defined end
   - Release : Dedicated teams 
 - release plan is required in when a release is scheduled for multiple sprints 
   - like quarterly or 6 months

### What is releasable?
 - Minimum Viable product
   - Increase speed to market
   - opportunity for development team to set expectations
   - Reveal hidden complexities
   - uncover dependencies 

### Pre-requisites
 - Product backlog
 - Prioritized backlog
 - team's Input - Infra, team capacity, 
 - product vision & road map


## Product Backlog

### What is it?
 - List of everything that needs to be done as part of the produc
 - Features
 - Functional Requirements
 - Non Functional System requirements
 - Enhancement Requests
 - Bug fixes
 - Infrastructure Changes
 - High Level features necessary to meet the goal
   - As a user (who), I want (what) , so that (Why)
   - Build everything on the product
 
### How to prioritize backlog?
 - Logical Ordered list of Items - dependencies 
 - Priority - Most important features first 
   - Minimum viable functionality
   - Business Value
   - Urgency
   - Opportunity Enablement 
   - Development Effort 

### Prioritization techniques
Relative Estimation
- T shirt sizing
  - Business value 
  - development effort
  - Pick high business value with low development effort
- WSJF (Weighted shortest job first)
  - Scale is based on fibonaci sequence
  - 4 categories - fibonacci score of all the scores
    - Business value
    - urgency
    - Opportunity 
    - Development Effort
  - Cost of delay - revenue impact
    - Combination of business value, urgency & opportunity
    - Business value + Urgency + Opportunity
  - WSJF - cost of delay/ development effort 

## User Stories
 - As a [user], I want [what], so that [why]
 - Requirements, Priorities, Acceptance criteria & Need of the user
 - Epic 
   - Larger user story
   - Collerction of user stories
 - User story provides business value but a task does not
 - User story makes sense to end user but a task might not
 - Split user stories
   - Easier to understand
   - Less chances of miscommunication
   - Helps in identifying waste
   - can be deliver sooner and can get feedback quickly
 - user story should be shippable and valuable to the customer
 - try to complete within a single sprint
 - Doable, Maybe, Not doable


## MVP
 - That version of the product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with least effort
